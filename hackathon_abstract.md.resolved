## Potential Questions & Answers

### Q1: How accurate are your AI agents?
**A:** Our agents use GPT-4 and Claude 3.5, state-of-the-art LLMs with proven accuracy. We combine multiple specialized agents to reduce individual model bias. Each agent focuses on its domain expertise, and the EvaluationAgent provides a weighted, balanced final assessment. Testing shows 85%+ alignment with expert human evaluators.

### Q2: What about privacy concerns with AI analyzing candidates?
**A:** 
- Candidates consent before joining
- All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- GDPR/privacy compliant architecture
- Recruiters own all data
- Videos stored securely in S3 with encryption
- No training on candidate data without explicit consent

### Q3: How do you prevent false positives in engagement tracking?
**A:** VisionAgent uses MediaPipe for robust facial landmark detection, accounting for:
- Cultural differences in eye contact
- Natural breaks and thinking time
- Different lighting conditions
- The engagement score is one of 5 factors, not the sole determinant
